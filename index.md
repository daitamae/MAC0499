### **Summary:**

Respiratory insufficiency or failure is a well-known medical symptom resultant from the inadequate gas exchange performed by the respiratory system. In 2020, respiratory insufficiency was identified as one of the severe symptoms of COVID-19 infection. The symptom is aggravated by a condition called _silent hypoxia_, low blood oxygen concentration without breath shortness, which particularly hinders its diagnosis. 
[SPIRA](https://spira.ime.usp.br/coleta/) is a research project created during the COVID-19 pandemic to identify respiratory insufficiency via speech recordings with Machine Learning models. It involves doctors, speech therapists, linguistics, and computer scientists from different fields (artificial intelligence, computer music, software engineering) and was idealized as a tool for doctors and nurses to pre-diagnose this illness.
After training a first batch of ML models to show that it is possible to make such pre-diagnoses, SPIRA envisions to create a new generation of more sophisticated models which will be tested in hospitals with real patients. Nevertheless, medical personnel do not have access to the SPIRA models, as they are not expected to have enough knowledge in Machine Learning to directly make predictions with them.
Thus, the present research aims to provide the desired access to SPIRA models by designing, developing and deploying such an inference system to be used by medical personnel.
